# Opinion Dynamics Seminar

## Introduction
Welcome to the repository for my seminar project on "Applications of Opinion Dynamics." I am currently pursuing my M.Tech. in Control and Computing (Electrical Engineering). This project involved a literature survey based on the research paper titled "[A tutorial on modeling and analysis of dynamic social networks. Part I](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arcontrol.2017.03.002)" by Anton V. Proskurnikov and Roberto Tempo.

## Project Overview
This seminar explores the various applications of opinion dynamics in different fields such as sociology, political science, and marketing. The study emphasizes the models of opinion dynamics and their implications in real-world scenarios.
